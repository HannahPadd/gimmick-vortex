This is very much a work in progress!!! Everyone is welcome to submit pull requests.

- the creation of new charts by uploading a song and being able to make a chart.
- editting existing charts.
- integrated .lua code generation for adding gimmicks to your stepfiles.
- integrated web-based text editor for your .sm files for if you want to add custom lua.
- a resource for new charters to see information about patterning, good practice etc.
- support for all game modes (4 panel, 5 panel, etc...)

# Building
This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
